  /*
   * 3.1.1. DATA TYPES Data representations are handled in FTP by a user specifying a representation type. This
   * type may implicitly (as in ASCII or EBCDIC) or explicitly (as in Local byte) define a byte size for
   * interpretation which is referred to as the &quot;logical byte size.&quot; Note that this has nothing to do with the
   * byte size used for transmission over the data connection, called the &quot;transfer byte size&quot;, and the two
   * should not be confused. For example, NVT-ASCII has a logical byte size of 8 bits. If the type is Local
   * byte, then the TYPE command has an obligatory second parameter specifying the logical byte size. The
   * transfer byte size is always 8 bits. 3.1.1.1. ASCII TYPE This is the default type and must be accepted by
   * all FTP implementations. It is intended primarily for the transfer of text files, except when both hosts
   * would find the EBCDIC type more convenient. The sender converts the data from an internal character
   * representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII representation (see the Telnet specification). The receiver
   * will convert the data from the standard form to his own internal form. In accordance with the NVT standard,
   * the &lt;CRLF&gt; sequence should be used where necessary to denote the end of a line of text. (See the discussion
   * of file structure at the end of the Section on Data Representation and Storage.) Using the standard
   * NVT-ASCII representation means that data must be interpreted as 8-bit bytes. The Format parameter for ASCII
   * and EBCDIC types is discussed below. 3.1.1.2. EBCDIC TYPE This type is intended for efficient transfer
   * between hosts which use EBCDIC for their internal character representation. For transmission, the data are
   * represented as 8-bit EBCDIC characters. The character code is the only difference between the functional
   * specifications of EBCDIC and ASCII types. End-of-line (as opposed to end-of-record--see the discussion of
   * structure) will probably be rarely used with EBCDIC type for purposes of denoting structure, but where it
   * is necessary the &lt;NL&gt; character should be used. 3.1.1.3. IMAGE TYPE The data are sent as contiguous bits
   * which, for transfer, are packed into the 8-bit transfer bytes. The receiving site must store the data as
   * contiguous bits. The structure of the storage system might necessitate the padding of the file (or of each
   * record, for a record-structured file) to some convenient boundary (byte, word or block). This padding,
   * which must be all zeros, may occur only at the end of the file (or at the end of each record) and there
   * must be a way of identifying the padding bits so that they may be stripped off if the file is retrieved.
   * The padding transformation should be well publicized to enable a user to process a file at the storage
   * site. Image type is intended for the efficient storage and retrieval of files and for the transfer of
   * binary data. It is recommended that this type be accepted by all FTP implementations. 3.1.1.4. LOCAL TYPE
   * The data is transferred in logical bytes of the size specified by the obligatory second parameter, Byte
   * size. The value of Byte size must be a decimal integer; there is no default value. The logical byte size is
   * not necessarily the same as the transfer byte size. If there is a difference in byte sizes, then the
   * logical bytes should be packed contiguously, disregarding transfer byte boundaries and with any necessary
   * padding at the end. When the data reaches the receiving host, it will be transformed in a manner dependent
   * on the logical byte size and the particular host. This transformation must be invertible (i.e., an
   * identical file can be retrieved if the same parameters are used) and should be well publicized by the FTP
   * implementors. For example, a user sending 36-bit floating-point numbers to a host with a 32-bit word could
   * send that data as Local byte with a logical byte size of 36. The receiving host would then be expected to
   * store the logical bytes so that they could be easily manipulated; in this example putting the 36-bit
   * logical bytes into 64-bit double words should suffice. In another example, a pair of hosts with a 36-bit
   * word size may send data to one another in words by using TYPE L 36. The data would be sent in the 8-bit
   * transmission bytes packed so that 9 transmission bytes carried two host words. 3.1.1.5. FORMAT CONTROL The
   * types ASCII and EBCDIC also take a second (optional) parameter; this is to indicate what kind of vertical
   * format control, if any, is associated with a file. The following data representation types are defined in
   * FTP: A character file may be transferred to a host for one of three purposes: for printing, for storage and
   * later retrieval, or for processing. If a file is sent for printing, the receiving host must know how the
   * vertical format control is represented. In the second case, it must be possible to store a file at a host
   * and then retrieve it later in exactly the same form. Finally, it should be possible to move a file from one
   * host to another and process the file at the second host without undue trouble. A single ASCII or EBCDIC
   * format does not satisfy all these conditions. Therefore, these types have a second parameter specifying one
   * of the following three formats: 3.1.1.5.1. NON PRINT This is the default format to be used if the second
   * (format) parameter is omitted. Non-print format must be accepted by all FTP implementations. The file need
   * contain no vertical format information. If it is passed to a printer process, this process may assume
   * standard values for spacing and margins. Normally, this format will be used with files destined for
   * processing or just storage. 3.1.1.5.2. TELNET FORMAT CONTROLS The file contains ASCII/EBCDIC vertical
   * format controls (i.e., &lt;CR&gt;, &lt;LF&gt;, &lt;NL&gt;, &lt;VT&gt;, &lt;FF&gt;) which the printer process will interpret
   * appropriately. &lt;CRLF&gt;, in exactly this sequence, also denotes end-of-line. 3.1.1.5.2. CARRIAGE CONTROL
   * (ASA) The file contains ASA (FORTRAN) vertical format control characters. (See RFC 740 Appendix C; and
   * Communications of the ACM, Vol. 7, No. 10, p. 606, October 1964.) In a line or a record formatted according
   * to the ASA Standard, the first character is not to be printed. Instead, it should be used to determine the
   * vertical movement of the paper which should take place before the rest of the record is printed. The ASA
   * Standard specifies the following control characters: Character Vertical Spacing blank Move paper up one
   * line 0 Move paper up two lines 1 Move paper to top of next page + No movement, i.e., overprint Clearly
   * there must be some way for a printer process to distinguish the end of the structural entity. If a file has
   * record structure (see below) this is no problem; records will be explicitly marked during transfer and
   * storage. If the file has no record structure, the &lt;CRLF&gt; end-of-line sequence is used to separate printing
   * lines, but these format effectors are overridden by the ASA controls.
