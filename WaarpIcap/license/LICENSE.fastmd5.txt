This was originally a rather straight re-implementation of the reference
implementation given in RFC1321 by RSA. It passes the MD5 test suite as
defined in RFC1321.

Many optimizations made by Timothy W Macinta. Reduced time to checksum a test
file in Java alone to roughly half the time taken compared with
java.security.MessageDigest (within an intepretter). Also added an optional
native method to reduce the time even further. See
http://www.twmacinta.com/myjava/fast_md5.php for further information on the
time improvements achieved.

Some bug fixes also made by Timothy W Macinta.

Please note: I (Timothy Macinta) have put this code in the com.twmacinta.util
package only because it came without a package. I was not the the original
author of the code, although I did optimize it (substantially) and fix some
bugs.
