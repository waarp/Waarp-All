   * 3.1.2. DATA STRUCTURES In addition to different representation types, FTP allows the structure of a file to
   * be specified. Three file structures are defined in FTP: file-structure, where there is no internal
   * structure and the file is considered to be a continuous sequence of data bytes, record-structure, where the
   * file is made up of sequential records, and page-structure, where the file is made up of independent indexed
   * pages. FileInterface-structure is the default to be assumed if the STRUcture command has not been used but
   * both file and record structures must be accepted for &quot;text&quot; files (i.e., files with TYPE ASCII or EBCDIC)
   * by all FTP implementations. The structure of a file will affect both the transfer mode of a file (see the
   * Section on Transmission Modes) and the interpretation and storage of the file. The &quot;natural&quot; structure of a
   * file will depend on which host stores the file. A source-code file will usually be stored on an IBM
   * Mainframe in fixed length records but on a DEC TOPS-20 as a stream of characters partitioned into lines,
   * for example by &lt;CRLF&gt;. If the transfer of files between such disparate sites is to be useful, there must be
   * some way for one site to recognize the other's assumptions about the file. With some sites being naturally
   * file-oriented and others naturally record-oriented there may be problems if a file with one structure is
   * sent to a host oriented to the other. If a text file is sent with record-structure to a host which is file
   * oriented, then that host should apply an internal transformation to the file based on the record structure.
   * Obviously, this transformation should be useful, but it must also be invertible so that an identical file
   * may be retrieved using record structure. In the case of a file being sent with file-structure to a
   * record-oriented host, there exists the question of what criteria the host should use to divide the file
   * into records which can be processed locally. If this division is necessary, the FTP implementation should
   * use the end-of-line sequence, &lt;CRLF&gt; for ASCII, or &lt;NL&gt; for EBCDIC text files, as the delimiter. If an FTP
   * implementation adopts this technique, it must be prepared to reverse the transformation if the file is
   * retrieved with file-structure. 3.1.2.1. FILE STRUCTURE FileInterface structure is the default to be assumed
   * if the STRUcture command has not been used. In file-structure there is no internal structure and the file
   * is considered to be a continuous sequence of data bytes. 3.1.2.2. RECORD STRUCTURE Record structures must
   * be accepted for &quot;text&quot; files (i.e., files with TYPE ASCII or EBCDIC) by all FTP implementations. In
   * record-structure the file is made up of sequential records. 3.1.2.3. PAGE STRUCTURE To transmit files that
   * are discontinuous, FTP defines a page structure. Files of this type are sometimes known as
   * &quot;random access files&quot; or even as &quot;holey files&quot;. In these files there is sometimes other information
   * associated with the file as a whole (e.g., a file descriptor), or with a section of the file (e.g., page
   * access controls), or both. In FTP, the sections of the file are called pages. To provide for various page
   * sizes and associated information, each page is sent with a page header. The page header has the following
   * defined fields: Header Length The number of logical bytes in the page header including this byte. The
   * minimum header length is 4. Page Index The logical page number of this section of the file. This is not the
   * transmission sequence number of this page, but the index used to identify this page of the file. Data
   * Length The number of logical bytes in the page data. The minimum data length is 0. Page Type The type of
   * page this is. The following page types are defined: 0 = Last Page This is used to indicate the end of a
   * paged structured transmission. The header length must be 4, and the data length must be 0. 1 = Simple Page
   * This is the normal type for simple paged files with no page level associated control information. The
   * header length must be 4. 2 = Descriptor Page This type is used to transmit the descriptive information for
   * the file as a whole. 3 = Access Controlled Page This type includes an additional header field for paged
   * files with page level access control information. The header length must be 5. Optional Fields Further
   * header fields may be used to supply per page control information, for example, per page access control. All
   * fields are one logical byte in length. The logical byte size is specified by the TYPE command. See Appendix
   * I for further details and a specific case at the page structure. A note of caution about parameters: a file
   * must be stored and retrieved with the same parameters if the retrieved version is to be identical to the
   * version originally transmitted. Conversely, FTP implementations must return a file identical to the
   * original if the parameters used to store and retrieve a file are the same.
