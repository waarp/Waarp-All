/**
 * This abstract class represents a handler for the WaarpR66 REST API. A handler
 * can handle one or multiple
 * entry points with multiple methods each.
 * <p>
 * To assign an entry point to a handler, use the {@link javax.ws.rs.Path}
 * annotation with the URI as value.
 * This annotation can also be used on methods of the handler to create entry
 * points below the handler's one.
 * <p>
 * For each entry point, all the desired HTTP methods must be assigned a
 * corresponding Java method using the
 * appropriate {@link javax.ws.rs.HttpMethod}. These methods must all have an
 * {@link HttpRequest} and a
 * {@link io.cdap.http.HttpResponder} as their first 2 parameters, which
 * correspond respectively to the
 * request and its reply. The methods may also have other parameters marked with
 * the
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.PathParam} annotation, meaning that these parameters
 * correspond to the {id} given in the
 * URI of the request. Some parameters may also be marked with the {@link
 * javax.ws.rs.QueryParam} an
 * annotation, in which case the parameter marked is referring to the query
 * parameter whose name is given in
 * the annotation's parameter. A query parameter can be given a default value
 * with the
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.DefaultValue} which will be assigned to the parameter when
 * the request does not contain
 * a value for it.
 * <p>
 * These methods should also be annotated with the {@link javax.ws.rs.Consumes}
 * annotation to indicate the
 * expected content type of the request. Finally, each method should also be
 * annotated with the
 * {@link RequiredRole} annotation to make the method only accessible to users
 * with the specified
 * {@link org.waarp.common.role.RoleDefault.ROLE} or higher.
